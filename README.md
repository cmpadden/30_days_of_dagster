# 30 Days of Orchestration

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3VUD1dRfvA

This repository, similar to other "Advent of Code" presents 30 daily challenges designed to introduce you to data orchestration. Each day's challenge becomes progressively harder. Can you master all 30 days and become a dagSTAR?

Please submit questions or alternate solutions as issues to the repository.

Happy Holidays, 

Dagster Team
